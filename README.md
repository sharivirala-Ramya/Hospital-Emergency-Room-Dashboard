# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard Using Excel
As part of my learning journey in interactive dashboard design, I created this project to analyze and visualize Emergency Room (ER) data. This dashboard helps monitor and interpret patient flow, admission status, departmental referrals, and wait time trends in a hospital ER setting.

 Project Highlights
 
1. Patient Admission Status
   
The dashboard displays the number of patients who were admitted vs. not admitted. Out of 9,216 total patients, 50% were admitted and 50% were not ‚Äì providing a balanced overview of ER outcomes.

2. Patient Age Distribution

Bar charts show patients grouped by age segments. The highest number of visits comes from the 20‚Äì29 age group, followed by 30‚Äì39. This helps identify which age groups are frequent ER users.

3. Timeliness of Care
   
A pie chart tracks whether patients were attended to on time (within 30 minutes).
59% were seen on time
41% experienced delays
This metric helps monitor ER efficiency and resource planning.

4. Gender Analysis
   
Gender distribution is nearly equal:
 Female: 51%
 Male: 49%

5. Department Referrals
   
The dashboard shows how many patients were referred to various departments. General Practice received the highest referrals, followed by Orthopedics and Physiotherapy ‚Äì offering insight into post-ER care demand.

 Additional Metrics
 
Total ER Patients: 9,216
Average Wait Time: 35.26 minutes
Average Patient Satisfaction Score: 4.99 / 5
Trends: Line charts show daily fluctuations in patient count, wait time, and satisfaction scores.
